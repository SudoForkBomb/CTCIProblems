public class DrawLine {

    /* Instructions
    A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte.
    The screen has width w, where wis divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the
    screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a
    horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).

    The method signature should look something like:
    drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)
